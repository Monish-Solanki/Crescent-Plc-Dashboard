## Overview
Impact of Promotions on Revenue and Customer Retention

This project analyzes impact of different promotional discounts (e.g., BOGOF, Percent Off, Free Shipping) on customer purchasing behavior, retention rates, and lifetime value (LTV).  

Using a simulated dataset of 2,000 customers and 10,000+ orders over one year, I built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to uncover insights that help businesses optimize promotional strategies.

## Business Problem

Do discounts and sales lead to more repeat customers or just one-time purchases?  
Which promotion types create sustainable customer loyalty and long-term profitability?

---

## Dataset

- **Customers:** 2,000 simulated customers with acquisition date, marketing channel, and acquisition promotion type.  
- **Orders:** 10,000+ orders with order dates, revenue, cost, and promotion applied.  
- **Promotions:** Three main promo types: BOGOF, Percent Off, Free Shipping, plus no promotion.  
- **Time Frame:** January 2024 - December 2024.

---

## Data Modeling

- Star schema with one fact table (orders) and three dimension tables (customers, promotions, date).  
- Clear relationship setup for optimal performance and ease of analysis.  
- Date table created with full time intelligence capabilities.

## Key Metrics & Analysis

- **Repeat Rate:** Percentage of customers who made more than one purchase.  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** Total revenue and profit generated by customers during the period.  
- **Retention Analysis:** Analysis of repeat behavior segmented by promotion type and marketing channel.  
- **Total Revenue:** Sum of Revenue from Jan 2024 - Dec 2024
- **Total Profit:** Sum of Profit from Jan 2024 - Dec 2024

## Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

- Executive summary with KPIs (Total Revenue, Total Profit, Repeat Rate, Average LTV).  
- Visuals comparing retention and LTV by promotion type and channel.  
- Revenue trends over time to observe promotional impact.  
- Customer segmentation by one-time vs repeat purchasers.

## Insights & Recommendations

Discounts do lead to more repeating customers however it depends on what type of promotion.

  For Example:
  -	BOGOF promotions generate the highest repeating customers (55.9% rate), encourages multiple purchases and suggest high customer satisfaction and customer loyalty.
  -	Other discounts like Percent Off and Free Shipping increase sales but also result in more customers being one-time buyers compared to BOGOF.
  -	Customers acquired without any promotion have the lowest repeat rate (25.7%) and the highest proportion of one-time buyers.

So, promotions like BOGOF effectively drive repeat purchases, while some discount types mainly create one-time sales.
This means Cresent Plc should strategically use promotions to balance between acquiring new customers and encouraging repeat purchases.

Also utilise email as a key marketing tool to drive and encourage more repeating purchases from customers.
